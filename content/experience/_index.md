        This section summarizes my academic, research, and teaching experience, highlighting my work in AI, cybersecurity, cyber-physical systems, and autonomous vehicles.

        ### Graduate Research Assistant  
        **West Virginia University** (Aug 2024 – Present)  
        - Research in adversarial AI, trustworthy autonomy, and CPS security.  
        - Developing resilient AI models for real-world deployment in AVs.  
        - Supporting DARPA-funded **AI CRAFT (US DoD, DARPA, 2024–26)** – Resilient AI & cybersecurity for robotics (Duckietown). Advancing perception-control in adversarial environments by leveraging context awareness, with a focus on vision-based object detection, semantic segmentation, and multimodal data fusion.

        ### Graduate Research Assistant & Teaching Assistant  
        **Virginia Commonwealth University** (Jan 2021 – Jul 2024)  
        - Led AI-driven security research for smart cities and CPS testbeds (OpenCyberCity).  
        - Published papers on smart IoT systems, adversary and game-theoretic cybersecurity.  

        ***Major Projects:***  
        - **Smart Cities Security (2023–24):** Proactive & reactive runtime monitoring, intrusion response under cyberattacks.
