      text: |
        A summary of my academic, research, and teaching roles.  
        This section highlights my journey as a researcher, educator, and practitioner in AI, cybersecurity, CPS, and autonomous vehicles.  

        ### Graduate Researcher  
        **West Virginia University** (Aug 2024 – Present)  
        - Research in adversarial AI, trustworthy autonomy, and CPS security.  
        - Developing resilient AI models for real-world deployment in AVs.  
        - Supporting DARPA-funded **AI CRAFT (US DoD, DARPA, 2024–26)** – Resilient AI & cybersecurity for robotics (Duckietown).  
          Focus: robust robotic perception & coordination in adversarial settings, with vision-based situational awareness (object detection, segmentation, LiDAR-camera fusion).  

        ### Graduate Research Assistant & Teaching Assistant  
        **Virginia Commonwealth University** (Jan 2021 – Jul 2024)  
        - Led AI-driven security research for smart cities and CPS testbeds (OpenCyberCity).  
        - Published papers on adversarial AI, smart IoT systems, and game-theoretic cybersecurity.  

        **Major Projects:**  
        - *Smart Cities Security (2023–24):* Proactive & reactive runtime monitoring, intrusion response under cyberattacks.  
        - *Adversarial Attacks in AVs (2022):* Detection models for adversarial BSM perturbations on DNN maneuver classifiers.  

        **Teaching Assistant Duties (VCU):**  
        - **EGRE 364: Microcomputer Systems** – Labs on microcontrollers, USART comms, stepper motors, line-following robots.  
        - **EGRE 337: Statistical Information Processing** – Probability distributions & statistical modeling → foundation for ML.  
        - **EGRE 245: Advanced Engineering Programming** – Advanced C: pointers, structures, linked lists, stacks, binary search.  
        - **EGRE 354: Digital Logic Design** – FPGA/digital design labs with Vivado.  
        - **EGRE 454: Automatic Controls** – Graded assignments on stability & pole-zero analysis.  

        ### Reviewer & Editorial Service  
        - **IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)**  
        - **Elsevier Computer Networks**
