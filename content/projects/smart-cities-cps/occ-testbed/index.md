Building secure and resilient **smart cities** requires realistic testbeds to study how cyber-physical systems (CPS) behave under real-world conditions.  
At VCU, the **OpenCyberCity (OCC) Testbed** was developed as a modular platform for **research and experimentation** on smart infrastructure.

## My Contributions
I contributed to OCC by working on:  
- **Smart Buildings & Homes:** integrating sensor/actuator nodes for HVAC, lighting, and energy management.  
- **Smart Water & Utilities:** Simulink-based CPS modeling of adaptive water distribution and resource allocation.  

## Cybersecurity & Resilience
A key focus was the development of an **Autonomous Intrusion Response System (IRS)**, which applies **Markov Decision Processes (MDP)** and reinforcement learning for autonomous defense.  
- Agents interact with smart city subsystems to learn defensive strategies.  
- Simulated adversarial scenarios include DoS, spoofing, FDI and hijacking attacks.

**Takeaway.** OCC connects **smart city development** with **cybersecurity research**, advancing sustainable infrastructure, IoT resilience, and autonomous defense strategies for next-generation urban systems.
