Smart cities rely on **resilient cyber-physical systems (CPS)** to manage critical infrastructure.  
This project focused on **adaptive control in smart water distribution networks**, integrating hydraulic system modeling with cyber feedback loops.

## Approach
- Developed **Simulink models** of multi-reservoir and multi-building distribution systems. ![Simulink hydraulic system model](/uploads/WDS_simulink.jpg)  
- Incorporated **PID controllers** for pump and valve actuation to regulate pressure and flow.  
- Designed **adaptive control loops** for uncertainty handling (e.g., variable demand, leak/fault conditions).  
- Modeled CPS integration — sensors (flow/pressure), actuators (pumps/valves), and communication delays.  

## Results
- Adaptive PID achieved **stable pressure regulation** across varying demand scenarios.  
- Demonstrated resilience under simulated disturbances (pump failures, pipe leaks).  
- Showed improved efficiency by reducing **energy consumption** while ensuring supply reliability.  

## Highlights
- Hands-on learning with **Simulink CPS modeling and PID tuning**.  
- Integration of physical dynamics (hydraulics) with cyber controls (sensing, decision-making).  
- Foundations for **secure and resilient CPS** in smart city infrastructure.  

**Takeaway.** Smart city CPS research requires **system-level thinking** — modeling, control, and security must work together to ensure safe and sustainable infrastructure.
