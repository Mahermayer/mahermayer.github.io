## Approach
- Developed **Simulink model** of multi-reservoir and multi-building distribution systems. ![Simulink hydraulic system model](/uploads/WDS_simulink.jpg)  
- Incorporated **PID controllers** for pump and valve actuation to regulate pressure and flow.  
- Designed **adaptive control loops** for uncertainty handling (e.g., variable demand, leak/fault conditions).  
## Results
- Adaptive PID achieved **stable pressure regulation** across varying demand scenarios.  
- Showed improved efficiency by reducing **energy consumption** while ensuring supply reliability.  

## Highlights
- Hands-on learning with **Simulink CPS modeling and PID tuning**.  
- Foundations for **secure and resilient CPS** in smart city infrastructure.  

**Takeaway.** Smart city CPS research requires **system-level thinking** â€” modeling, control, and security must work together to ensure safe and sustainable infrastructure.
