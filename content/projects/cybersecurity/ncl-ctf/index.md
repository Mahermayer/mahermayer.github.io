The **National Cyber League (NCL)** is a hands-on competition that tests defensive and offensive skills across realistic challenges in cryptography, forensics, web exploitation, and network analysis.

I participated in **Spring 2025** and placed in the **97th percentile**, demonstrating broad applied skill across CTF categories:

**Representative tasks**
- **Cryptography & cipher decoding:** classical cipher analysis (Caesar, Vigenère) and modern crypto challenges — frequency analysis, known-plaintext attacks, block/stream cipher reasoning, and key-recovery tactics where applicable.  
- **Password cracking:** hash cracking with **Hashcat/John**, targeted dictionaries (e.g. *rockyou*), rule-based masks, and hybrid brute-force strategies.  
- **Network forensics & traffic analysis:** PCAP triage and indicator extraction with **Wireshark**, **Scapy**, and log correlation.
- **Wireless & capture/relay:** practical use of **Aircrack-ng** and traffic replay techniques where applicable.
- **Binary / reverse & memory forensics:** basic reverse engineering and volatile memory analysis with **Volatility**.  
- **Web exploitation & SQLi:** discovery and exploitation using **Burp**, **sqlmap**, and manual payload crafting.  

**Tools used**
Nmap, Metasploit, Burp Suite, sqlmap, Netcat, Hashcat, John, Aircrack-ng, Wireshark, Scapy, Volatility, Ghidra.

**Takeaway.** NCL sharpened both offensive tooling and defensive investigation workflows — the exact practical skills applied daily in red/blue exercises and incident response.
