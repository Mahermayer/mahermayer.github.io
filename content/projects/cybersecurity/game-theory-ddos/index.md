Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) remains a **severe threat** for cloud-hosted systems.

In this work, we model the attackerâ€“defender interaction as a **game-theoretic problem**, where both parties strategically allocate resources.

**Approach**
- Modeled attacker payoffs (resource cost vs. disruption impact).  
- Defender strategies: **local defense, AWS Shield, AWS WAF**.  
- Payoffs captured both **legitimate traffic penalties** (false positives/false negatives) and **attack costs**.  
- Analysis conducted across three boundary conditions of attack volume relative to processing capacity.  

### Results & Nash Equilibria
- **Multiple Nash Equilibria** emerged depending on organizational size and attacker resources.  
  - **Small organizations**: Equilibrium tends to be *(No Attack, Local Defense)* since attacker costs outweigh rewards. 
  - **Medium organizations**: Defender shifts between AWS Shield or WAF depending on comparative cost vs. expected DDoS loss.  
  - **Large organizations**: Nash equilibrium favors AWS WAF due to high DDoS loss costs, making external defense optimal.  
- A **pure Nash equilibrium** was demonstrated in special cases where both attack reward and defense loss are small, resulting in no attack being launched.  
- The model showed equilibrium-based strategies reduce downtime by up to **40% compared to static defenses**, while keeping mitigation cost-effective.  

**Highlights**
- First model to integrate **cloud-based defense services** (AWS Shield, WAF) with game-theoretic security.  
- Captures **strategic attacker behavior** under spoofed vs. real IP traffic.  
- Demonstrates practical **decision-making framework** for organizations at different scales.  
- Conference paper contribution on **strategic defense in cyber-physical systems**.  

**Takeaway.** Game-theoretic security provides a principled way to identify **Nash equilibria** that minimize costs and adaptively defend against DDoS, guiding organizations toward **cost-effective, resilient cloud defense strategies**.
