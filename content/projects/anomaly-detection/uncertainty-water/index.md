In smart water distribution, anomaly detection must go beyond labels â€” **prediction confidence matters**.  
We developed a **Bayesian LSTM** framework to forecast water demand while quantifying uncertainty.  

**Highlights**
- Captures both anomaly likelihood and confidence.  
- Distinguishes between **true anomalies** vs. model uncertainty.  
- Supports safe and robust decision-making for water infrastructure.  

**Takeaway.** Adding **uncertainty quantification** to anomaly detection reduces false alarms and improves resilience in CPS.
