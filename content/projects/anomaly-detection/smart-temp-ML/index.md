We integrated **anomaly detection, predictive forecasting, and control** for IoT-based smart building temperature regulation.  

**Pipeline**
- **Random Forest** detects **false data injection (FDI) anomalies**.  
- **LSTM forecasting** predicts safe thresholds.  
- **PID control** corrects deviations in real-time.  

**Highlights**
- Prevents energy waste and unsafe operations.  
- Maintains comfort under sensor or network attacks.  
- Demonstrates CPS cyber-physical integration of ML + control.  

**Takeaway.** Secure, anomaly-aware control ensures **energy-efficient and resilient smart buildings.**
