Basic Safety Messages (BSMs) are the backbone of **V2V/V2I communication** in connected autonomous vehicles.  
We evaluated multiple **machine learning classifiers** — including Random Forest, SVM, and Neural Networks — to detect anomalous or malicious BSMs.  

**Highlights**
- Real-time classification of anomalous messages.  
- Differentiates malicious injections from natural noise.  
- Strengthens communication trust in CAV networks.  

**Takeaway.** ML-based anomaly detection enhances **safety and reliability** in cooperative driving systems.
