This work explores **context-aware autonomous driving** when lane markings are degraded, occluded, or adversarially perturbed.  

We propose **LaneNet**, a U-Net modified with **depthwise separable convolutions** and **squeeze-and-excitation attention**, designed to provide lightweight yet robust lane segmentation.

We utilize a **spatio-temporal context** to infer lane centers when lane pixels are missing or corrupted. This enables smooth control in degraded and adversarial conditions.

## System Setup
- Same base setup as in **Vision AI-based Autonomous Driving**, running on Duckietown with Dockerized ROS nodes.  
- Includes robustness evaluation under **physical degradation** (faded/missing lanes) and **adversarial AI attacks**.

**Takeaway.** With context-aware reasoning, the system remains stable even when lane markings are incomplete or perturbed by adversarial inputs.
