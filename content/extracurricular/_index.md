        Beyond research, I actively engage in community, leadership, and outreach activities that complement my academic journey.

        ### Leadership & Mentorship
        - **Cybersecurity Club Mentor (2023â€“present):** Guided students in Capture-the-Flag (CTF) competitions, introducing adversarial AI challenges and AV security scenarios.  
        - **Graduate Student Mentor:** Advised junior students on research methods, publications, and navigating graduate studies.  

        ### Outreach & Service
        - **STEM Outreach Volunteer:** Conducted robotics and AI workshops for high school students to promote interest in autonomous systems and cybersecurity.  
        - **Conference Involvement:** Presented posters and engaged in discussions at IEEE SmartComp 2024 (Best Poster Award).  

        ### Competitions
        - **Capture the Flag (CTF):** Active participant in beginner-to-intermediate cybersecurity competitions, focusing on reverse engineering, password cracking, and AV-related security challenges.  
        - **Duckietown Robotics Challenges:** Hands-on experimentation with reinforcement learning, lane-following, and resilient AV autonomy.  

        ### Community Engagement
        - **LinkedIn Knowledge Sharing:** Summarize and explain state-of-the-art papers on adversarial AI and AVs in short, accessible formats for broader academic and professional communities.  
        - **Open-Source Contributions:** Maintaining and extending repositories for AV resilience and Duckietown integration.
